# set-in-stone

This repository has been created in order to publish a demo of my interview with Thomas, CEO of Set In Stone.

To Thomas,

Dear Thomas, in order to show how one could proceed, I published some files of a personal project that is similar to the Rugby game exercice. What is called card can be tought of as Pool. As a card, a Pool is defined as structure that defines Pool's variables. These variables, which represent properties of the Pool can be static (in that case, they are define during the Pool creation) or dynamique (in that case one needs a function that can modify them).
